> 4 Geeks Academy - project by @karenL26 :elf:

This is a simple project using Naive Bayes Classifier and Scikit-learn to create a Google Play store reviews classifier (Sentiment Analysis) in Python. It will categorize user reviews as good or bad. In this dataset, it would be used the 23 most popular mobile apps, and only two columns.

In this project you can find some basic exploratory analysis and the data preparation for modeling [here](src/explore_nb.ipynb).

The model construction use Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes. 

The final model construction is [here](src/app.py).

The dataset was obtained from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/naive-bayes-project-tutorial/main/playstore_reviews_dataset.csv).
